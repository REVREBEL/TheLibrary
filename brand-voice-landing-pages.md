# Brand Voice: Landing Page Copy

This document contains REVREBEL's landing page headlines and CTAs that demonstrate brand positioning - balancing confidence, service clarity, and independent hotel focus.

---

## Primary Value Proposition Headlines

### Headline 1: Independent, On Purpose

```
INDEPENDENT, ON PURPOSE

We don't do one-size-fits-all. You deserve a strategy built around your unique strengths — not brand templates. Let's unlock what's next.

[START YOUR CUSTOM PLAN]
```

**Voice Notes:**
- Brand positioning in header ("Independent")
- Contrarian stance ("don't do one-size-fits-all")
- Challenges industry norm ("brand templates")
- Action-oriented ("unlock what's next")
- CTA = immediate value

**Target Audience:** Independent hotel owners/operators

**Tone:** Confident, challenger brand, consultative

---

### Headline 2: Let's Build What Your Brand Deserves

```
LET'S BUILD WHAT YOUR BRAND DESERVES

Independent hotels don't fit into cookie-cutter solutions — and neither do we. You need a partner who gets the nuances, finds the upside, and delivers a custom strategy built around your property's potential. Let's start crafting a plan that actually works for you.

[LET'S TALK]
```

**Voice Notes:**
- Collaborative framing ("Let's build")
- Parallel structure (independent hotels / neither do we)
- Value-based language ("deserves," "potential")
- Three-beat list (gets nuances, finds upside, delivers strategy)
- Emphasis on customization
- CTA = conversational ("Let's talk" vs "Contact us")

**Target Audience:** Boutique/independent hotel decision-makers

**Tone:** Partnership-focused, empathetic, action-oriented

## Landing Page Copy Rules

### ✅ DO:

- Position against generic/corporate solutions
- Use "independent" as pride point
- Emphasize customization and nuance
- Make CTAs conversational, not transactional
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use collaborative language ("Let's")

### ❌ DON'T:

- Say "world-class" or "best-in-class"
- Use generic CTAs like "Learn More"
- Position as vendor (be partner)
- Use corporate jargon
- Be vague about what you deliver
- Oversell with superlatives

---

## CTA Voice Guidelines

### Strong CTAs:
- **"START YOUR CUSTOM PLAN"** - Action + value
- **"LET'S TALK"** - Collaborative, human
- **"UNLOCK YOUR POTENTIAL"** - Aspirational
- **"GET STARTED"** - Simple, direct

### Weak CTAs (Avoid):
- "Learn More" - Too generic
- "Contact Us" - Too corporate
- "Submit" - Too transactional
- "Click Here" - Too technical

## Headline Formula Patterns

### Pattern 1: Statement of Belief
```
[PRINCIPLE], [EMPHASIS]
Example: "INDEPENDENT, ON PURPOSE"
```

### Pattern 2: Collaborative Call-to-Action
```
LET'S [ACTION] WHAT [VALUE]
Example: "LET'S BUILD WHAT YOUR BRAND DESERVES"
```

### Pattern 3: Contrarian Position
```
[TARGET AUDIENCE] don't [GENERIC APPROACH] — and neither do we
Example: "Independent hotels don't fit into cookie-cutter solutions — and neither do we"
```
