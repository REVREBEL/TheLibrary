# Brand Voice: Error Messages & Form Validation

This document catalogs REVREBEL's approach to error messaging and form validation copy - demonstrating how brand voice remains consistent even in technical/functional contexts.

---

## Philosophy

Error messages are opportunities to:
- Maintain brand personality during friction moments
- Show empathy without being patronizing  
- Guide users clearly toward resolution
- Inject subtle humor to reduce frustration
- Stay technical and precise (never vague)

---

## General Form Error Messages

### Generic Fallback

**Copy:**
```
Something went sideways. Try again — we're rooting for you.
```

**Context:** Generic fallback for form submission errors when specific cause is unknown

**Voice Notes:**
- Conversational ("went sideways")
- Supportive ("rooting for you")
- Action-oriented ("Try again")
- No blame placed on user

---

### Close But Not Perfect

**Copy:**
```
404: Perfect Submission Not Found. But close! Double-check your info and resubmit.
```

**Context:** Form validation failed but submission was attempted

**Voice Notes:**
- Playful HTTP status reference
- Encourages user ("But close!")
- Clear next action
- Nerdy technical reference

---

### Field Validation Failed

**Copy:**
```
Well, that didn't go as planned.

Looks like a field might be missing or mistyped. Give it another shot.
```

**Context:** Missing required field or incorrect format

**Voice Notes:**
- Honest acknowledgment
- Helpful diagnosis
- Casual encouragement

---

### Resilience Theme

**Copy:**
```
Even rebels hit roadblocks.

Check your info and try again — we'll make it worth your while.
```

**Context:** Form error on retry attempt

**Voice Notes:**
- Brand personality reference ("rebels")
- Empathetic framing
- Promise of value

---

### System/Technical Error

**Copy:**
```
System Glitch. Signal Lost.

Try refreshing or reloading your intel. Then hit submit again.
```

**Context:** Server error, timeout, or connection issue

**Voice Notes:**
- Tech/sci-fi metaphor ("Signal Lost")
- Military/espionage framing ("intel")
- Clear troubleshooting steps

---

## Email or Required Field Errors

### Missing Required Field

**Copy:**
```
Looks like something's missing. Let's tighten it up.
```

**Context:** User submitted form with empty required field

**Voice Notes:**
- Collaborative tone ("Let's")
- Action metaphor ("tighten it up")
- No blame, just guidance

---

### Invalid Email Format

**Copy:**
```
We need a valid email to beam back the good stuff.

Try re-entering it (without the typos).
```

**Context:** Email field has invalid format

**Voice Notes:**
- Sci-fi metaphor ("beam back")
- Value reminder ("the good stuff")
- Lighthearted typo reference

---

### Multiple Missing Fields

**Copy:**
```
The form gods demand more information.

Check the fields above and try again.
```

**Context:** Multiple required fields left empty

**Voice Notes:**
- Playful mythology reference
- Specific direction ("fields above")
- Maintains humor during frustration

---

### Email Decode Error

**Copy:**
```
We tried decoding that email... but it doesn't compute.

Mind checking it for typos?
```

**Context:** Email validation failed

**Voice Notes:**
- Technical metaphor ("decoding," "compute")
- Polite request ("Mind checking")
- Likely cause identified (typos)

---

### Mission-Critical Detail Missing

**Copy:**
```
Error: You skipped a mission-critical detail.

Fill in the required fields to complete transmission.
```

**Context:** Required field validation on important forms

**Voice Notes:**
- Military/mission framing
- Tech terminology ("transmission")
- Clear severity ("mission-critical")
